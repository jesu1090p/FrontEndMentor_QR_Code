### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Struggling a bit with aligning items using flex-box but finally got as close as I could to the desktop result. 

### Continued development

I'd like to master CSS and Javascript to become a FrontEnd dev and boost my carreer on this field. In the near future I expect to start a position as a React developer.


### Useful resources

- [Aligning Items in a Flex Container](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - This helped me center the container and main div.
